generated reports of ALL employees of a Canadian hardware manufacturing enterprise based in 45 locations nationwide using a single secure internal database. You cannot remove any data because it is the companyâ€™s policy. The data can only be manipulated, and the reports are created through an Intranet web portal where specialized users can only access it.
Your team, IT Business Architects, were tasked by the IT manager to propose a design for the solution by presenting a detailed report describing the effect, functionality, and advantage of having such a Web service solution developed for the enterprise. The report must be presented in a high-level format (do not discuss IT technologies.) Also, provide the UML class diagram displaying classes, attributes, operations, and their relationships with a detailed discussion of those elements in your report.
